📁 Maternal Hemoglobin Analysis - Linear Regression Results

🧪 What We Did
We built a linear regression model to see if we can predict **Z-Score** (standardized hemoglobin) from Result (raw hemoglobin level) in 195 maternal patients.


📊 Model Performance

| Metric        | Value     | What It Means |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| R² Score      | 1.0       | Perfect score! 100% of variation explained |
| RMSE          | 8.63e-16  | Errors are practically ZERO |
| MAE           | 7.32e-16  | Predictions are almost exact |
| Coefficient   | 0.756     | Each +1 g/dL Hb increases Z-Score by 0.756 |
| Intercept     | -8.693    | Z-Score = 0 when Hb = 11.5 g/dL |


Z-Score is calculated from the result using this formula:

> Z = (Result - Mean) ÷ Standard Deviation**

Our model simply discovered this formula:
- Coefficient = 1 ÷ Std = 0.756
- Intercept = -Mean ÷ Std = -8.693

So the model isn't learning patterns—it's just doing math we already did.



📸 What the Graphs Tell Us

| Graph                   | What We See   | What It Means   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Predicted vs Actual     | Perfect diagonal line           | Predictions = Actual values |
| Residual Density Plot   | Bell-shaped curve               | Errors are random & normal |
| Q-Q Plot                | Points on straight line         | Residuals are normally distributed |
| Box Plot                | One dot at 7.3 g/dL             | 1 outlier - severe anemia case |
| Pair Plot               | Result & Z-Score = perfect line | Confirms mathematical relationship |



🩺 Clinical Findings (Real Insights)

Despite the modeling issue, the **data itself** gives us useful information:

| Finding                | Value           | Interpretation |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|  Average Hemoglobin    | 11.5 g/dL       | Normal for pregnancy (mild dilution) |
|  Hemoglobin Range      | 7.3 – 14.2 g/dL | From severe anemia to normal         |
|  Outlier               | 7.3 g/dL        | 1 patient with severe anemia — needs follow-up |
|  Gravidity Effect      | Weak positive   | Slightly higher Hb in women with more pregnancies |
|  Testing Methods       | LAMP vs SOC     | Both methods present — can be compared |


✅ What This Analysis DOES Confirm

- ✅ Z-scores were calculated correctly
- ✅ Data is clean and well-structured
- ✅ Regression assumptions are understood
- ✅ Outliers can be detected
- ✅ You now understand **why** predicting a transformation of your target is meaningless
